# CRYPTO CRUD APP

## Full-stack project

## About

This mini application is a CRUD web app built with Flask. It allows users to add new cryptocurrencies to a personal database. When adding a new record, the app makes an API call to CoinGecko to verify that the cryptocurrency exists.

The application leverages asynchronous programming to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience. Additionally, it features real-time updates, allowing new records to be added or deleted without requiring a page refresh.
